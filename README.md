# FractaSound
A Dynamic Audio Visualizer Utilizing Fractal Patterns

#### Abstract :
  FractaSound is a fractal-based audio visualizer; this Java desktop application aims to provide users with an appealing and customizable animation accompaniment for music. After installing the application, users will be able to import their own music in .WAV or .MP3 form. Users may also select one of several color theme presets to customize the animation to their liking. During the process of the visualization, pitch and volume is extracted by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), to produce a fractal animation using the fundamental frequency of a current audio sample of the input music. This combination of pitch and volume is used to render a specific Julia Set fractal belonging to the Mandelbrot Set, creating an intuitive and interesting audio visualizer for all to enjoy.
